There are two new files in this folder that are word templates (Allen Resume Template, Cover Letter Template)

To make a new word doc using the baseline template you just double click
To make actual adjustments to the templates themselves Right Click->Open and make changes to the actual document

The reason you want to do this is so you know for a fact the formatting is the same. Often times people copy paste stuff in and dont realize whether their headings and other stuff have different formats.

The main changes:

I've changed the margins in order to compress your resume into 1 sheet. Space should really be used efficiently to get things to not only flow well but also to get it down to 1 page. They will not look at your resume or cover for extensive periods of time anyway.

Steps:

1. Look at the adjustments that I've made inside the word docs with track changes
2. Change whatever you happen to agree with
3. Check the grammar (Using free Grammarly app for Word)
4. Double click on the relevant template
5. Copy paste the sections into the template (When you copy and paste, make sure you keep the formatting consistent in the document)
6. Check the actual document formatting (Size of headers text, Select All -> Times New Roman for the text if applicable)
7. Your document should be formatted consistently now, and on one page if at all possible


Note: I left the actual example inside the template, you might want to just delete the actual content out of the sections so its easier to copy and paste. I just wanted to leave one example in the template itself so its obvious what it should look like.

I've made changes to these cover letters:
Relic Vancouver
STEMCELL Vancouver (Instrumentation)

Realistically, since you are more or less applying to the same place multiple times, I think you should just follow those two examples that I've provided. It seems that in general, the requirements and expectations set out by the application is really not much so I can't really say much in terms of what to really emphasize. You should try and copy the formats/wording of the two examples that I've provided.

General comments:
I'm not sure why you randomly decide to capitalize some words in your Resume but don't do that
Really nail down the formatting, I think you messed up sizes of fonts multiple times
In Word it seems like you just resize the text to whatever you want instead of using document styles You should use styles wherever possible so that formatting is never messed up.
I think the stuff about coming back to Vancouver as your hometown is completely unnecessary but if you want to keep it then that's your choice. In general shorter is better in my opinion.


The resumes look decent, just download Grammarly for word to make sure your wording is decent and check it:
